[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pineboat/react-continuous-deployment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pineboat/react-continuous-deployment)

This is an excercise project written as part of a blog post for [PineBoat](https://pineboat.in). Takes the user through setting up new react project using `create-react-app` until getting the app built and deployed automatically using Travis CI.

It ends with the build status badge you see above.
